# Data Validation

Absl includes a convenient method for checking duplicate entries in your database tables. This feature allows you to validate whether a specific column contains a duplicate value before performing certain operations, such as creating or updating records.

To check for duplicate entries, you can use the `checkDuplicate()` method provided by Absl. This method takes the name of the unique column and the value to be checked as input. Absl executes a query to search for existing records with the specified value in the designated column. If a matching record is found, it returns `true`, indicating a duplicate entry. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

Here's an example of how to use the `checkDuplicate()` method:

```php
// Specify the unique column and the value to be checked
$uniqueColumn = 'email';
$checkValue = 'user@example.com';

// Check for duplicate entry
$isDuplicate = $absl->checkDuplicate($uniqueColumn, $checkValue);

if ($isDuplicate) {
    // Duplicate entry exists, handle the validation failure
    // ...
} else {
    // No duplicate entry found, proceed with the desired operation
    // ...
}
```

By utilizing Absl's data validation feature, you can easily ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate entries in your database tables. This is particularly useful when dealing with fields that require uniqueness, such as email addresses, usernames, or any other unique identifiers in your application.

Absl simplifies the process of checking for duplicate entries, allowing you to focus on implementing your business logic without worrying about manually executing SQL queries or dealing with complex validation routines.
