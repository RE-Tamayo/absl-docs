# Authentication

Absl provides functionality for user authentication, allowing you to authenticate user credentials against your database records. This enables you to implement secure login systems and protect access to restricted areas of your application.

The `authenticate()` method in Absl handles the authentication process. It takes an array of user credentials as input, typically containing key-value pairs representing the username or email and the corresponding password. The method checks the provided credentials against the stored values in the designated table.

Here's an example of how to authenticate user credentials using Absl:

```php
// Prepare the user credentials
$credentials = [
    'username' => 'john_doe',
    'password' => 'secretpassword', //The password field should always be last on the array
];

// Authenticate the user
$isAuthenticated = $absl->authenticate($credentials);

if ($isAuthenticated) {
    // User authentication successful, grant access or redirect to the authorized area
    // ...
} else {
    // User authentication failed, handle invalid credentials
    // ...
}
```

In the example above, the `authenticate()` method checks if the provided username and password match an existing user record in the designated table. If a match is found and the password is verified, the method returns `true`, indicating successful authentication. Otherwise, it returns `false`, indicating authentication failure.

By leveraging Absl's authentication capabilities, you can implement robust user authentication systems with ease, ensuring the security and integrity of user accounts within your application.
