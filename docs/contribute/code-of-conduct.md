# Code of Conduct
---
I expect all contributors and users of the Absl library to adhere to the following code of conduct:

1. **Be respectful and inclusive**: Treat everyone with respect and kindness. Respect differences in opinions, experiences, and backgrounds. Foster a welcoming and inclusive environment where all individuals feel safe and valued.

2. **Be collaborative**: Encourage a collaborative and supportive community. Offer assistance, guidance, and constructive feedback to fellow contributors and users. Embrace diverse perspectives and work together towards common goals.

3. **Be professional**: Maintain a professional and courteous demeanor in all interactions. Refrain from personal attacks, harassment, or any form of disruptive behavior. Remember that we may have users and contributors from different cultural backgrounds and professional environments.

4. **Follow ethical guidelines**: Ensure that your contributions align with ethical standards. Respect intellectual property rights and avoid any unauthorized use or distribution of copyrighted material. Be mindful of legal and ethical considerations when working with sensitive or personal data.

5. **Stay focused**: Keep discussions and contributions relevant to the Absl library. Avoid going off-topic or engaging in unrelated discussions that may distract or detract from the purpose of the community.

6. **Report violations**: If you witness or experience any violations of this code of conduct, please report the issue to the project maintainers. Provide as much detail as possible, including any supporting evidence, to help us address the situation appropriately.

By participating in the Absl community, you agree to uphold and abide by this code of conduct. Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in temporary or permanent restrictions on participation in the community.

I strive to foster an inclusive and respectful environment for all contributors and users, and I appreciate your cooperation in maintaining a positive community experience.
